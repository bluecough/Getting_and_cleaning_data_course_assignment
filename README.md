### Getting and Cleaning Data     ###

This script called run_analysis.R is called without arguments. The data this script analyses can be found from the following link. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The data set that is being analysed is from 30 participants or in other words “Subjects”. These subjects each carry a cell phone device that collects accelerometer data. These subjects are asked to perform six different “Activities”.

Only the mean and standard deviation data is analyzed by this script.

The result of the run_analysis.R script reveals 180 observations and 68 variables.

Please refer to the CodeBood.md to understand the variables, data and the transform at work to clean the data.
